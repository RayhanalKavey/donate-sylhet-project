          This should be another wake-up call for us as flooding increasingly
          becomes the most common climate-related risk to Bangladesh. The

              Disaster victims can survive for several days without food, but
              only for a short time without water. Water from streams, lakes and
              local water systems can become contaminated; therefore, it is best
              to store a supply of water in the shelter area.
